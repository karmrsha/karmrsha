- im always on the 18+ server just sitting, usually with a friend
- i am c+h (cuddle + hide)!! Please feel free to cuddle or hide! Kissing is also good, i love kisses
- i dont mind covering, so if you are doing it delibrately to get a reaction out of me, you arent getting one lol
- im usually on Busy but you can interact with me :) preferably through whispers however because i am incredibly blind and most of the time might be looking at my other monitor/offtab
- i will most likely boop you if you ship jayvik. i fucking love jayvik, please boop me too if im in a viktor skin 🙏
- dont interact if you're here to start drama/arguments or be a dickhead. im never in the mood to deal with someone that wants to actively cause issues 💜

**If you find me in PT and want me to show you some skins I have listed below, I can :) just whisper me!**
